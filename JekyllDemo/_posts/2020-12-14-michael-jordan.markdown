## ​​The Decision-Making Side of Machine Learning: Computational, Inferential and Economic Perspectives

### Abstract
Much of the recent focus in machine learning has been on the pattern-recognition side of the field.  I will focus instead on the decision-making side, where many fundamental challenges remain.  Some are statistical in nature, including the challenges associated with multiple decision-making, and some are algorithmic, including the challenge of coordinated decision-making on distributed platforms.  Finally, others are economic, involving learning systems that must cope with scarcity and competition.  I will present recent progress on each of these fronts.
