## AI for researc​h and some new results on deep regression

### Abstract
This talk has two loosely connected parts: In the first part we discuss (using fairly concrete examples) how AI/ML can be used for research in classical areas of natural science and medicine. The illustrations stem from physics, medicine and biology that we have worked with over the past 2-3 years. The idea is to make a case for using AI/ML as a tool in research within more classical academic disciplines. This is tightly linked to the AI strategy of Uppsala University that I will briefly introduce as well. In the second part (which is perhaps slightly more technical) we develop a new approach to deep regression. While deep learning-based classification is generally addressed using standardized approaches, a wide variety of techniques are employed when it comes to regression. We have developed a new and general deep regression method with a clear probabilistic interpretation. We obtain good performance on several computer vision regression tasks (including a new state-of-the-art result on visual tracking).
