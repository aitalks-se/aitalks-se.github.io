## Fairness in AI and in Algorithms

### Abstract
With the increasing role played by AI and algorithms in our lives, it is well-recognized now that fairness should be a key aspect of such AI systems, to avoid automated decision-making that may (inadvertently) be biased. After surveying some of the approaches considered in this general area, we will discuss some of our work on fairness -- particularly in unsupervised learning.
