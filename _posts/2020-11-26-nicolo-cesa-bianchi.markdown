## Cooperation in networks of learning agents

### Abstract
We study the power of cooperation in a network of communicating agents that solve a learning task. Agents use an underlying communication network to get information about the behavior of other agents. In the talk, we show the extent to which cooperation allows us to prove performance bounds that are strictly better than the known bounds for non-cooperating agents. Our results are formulated within the online learning setting, under both the full and partial feedback models.
