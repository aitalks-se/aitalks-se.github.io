## Calling all Citizen Scientists: using Bayesian Statistics to advance public input into scientific analysis

### Abstract
Many scientific projects are benefitting strongly from the contribution of information by community members. For example, citizen scientists might classify arrays of ecological images or express risks about medical or social outcomes under hypothetical scenarios. However, these data can pose challenges for the scientist and analyst. Three such challenges are how to elicit the required information when this is in the form of expressed opinions, how to combine these opinions, and how to evaluate the credibility of crowd-sourced data.  

In this presentation, I will describe the efforts of members of our research team to address these challenges, and set this work in the context of a number of case studies that motivate the research. In particular, I will focus on the use of Bayesian models to frame the problem, incorporate the various sources of information and express the desired probabilistic outcomes. These approaches include Bayesian Networks, spatial measurement-error and item-response models, and meta-analysis.   

This research has been undertaken in collaboration with a range of colleagues who will be acknowledged in the presentation.
