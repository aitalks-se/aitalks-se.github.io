## Deep Visual Reasoning with Optimization-based Network Modules

### Abstract
Deep learning approaches have achieved astonishing performance in
numerous vision applications, including image classification, object
detection, and semantic segmentation. While these problems are easily
treated with standard feed-forward architectures, many computer vision
problems require more complex reasoning about the information given
during inference. In particular, more sophisticated autonomous agents
need to be able to learn new concepts and abilities “on the fly”, given
only limited data and supervision. However, developing effective
end-to-end learnable methods for few-shot and online learning tasks have
turned out to be a formidable challenge.

We tackle this challenge by designing deep network modules that
internally optimize an objective. Since key problems in many computer
vision tasks can be formulated as objective functions,
optimization-based network modules are able to perform effective and
efficient reasoning in such circumstances. By further learning the
objective function itself, we obtain a general family of deep network
modules, capable of more complex non-local reasoning. We will cover
their application within a variety of tasks, including visual tracking,
video object segmentation, few-shot segmentation, dense correspondence
estimation, and multi-frame image restoration.
