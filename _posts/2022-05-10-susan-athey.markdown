## AI for Social Impact: Applications and Opportunities

### Abstract
Artificial Intelligence holds great promise as a technology that can be used for social impact.  Yet, there are surprisingly few rigorous evaluations of how AI implementations improve outcomes, and AI implementations in social impact applications often face impediments such as poor performance in small datasets and uncertainty about the payoff from required engineering effort.  They also suffer from concerns about an inability to quantify and measure relevant outcomes in a timely way. In this talk, I will review several recent applications of artificial intelligence for impact, highlighting solutions to date and open challenges.
